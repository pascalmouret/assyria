# Assyria

Assyria is an operating system written in NIM. When I say "operating system", that currently doesn't mean much execpt that it can print to a VGA terminal without the help of a real operating system.

I started tis project to learn more about the x86 processor, operating systems in general and NIM. All of which is pretty stupid since this is my first real project in NIM and the last time I wrote anything even nearly as low level was a decade ago when I wrote some code for LEGO Mindstorms.

If you're wondering where the name comes from - Assyria is the land once ruled by Nimrod, according to legend.
