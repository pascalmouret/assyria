# Assyria

Assyria is an operating system written in NIM. When I say "operating system", that currently doesn't mean much except that it can print to a VGA terminal.

I started this project to learn more about the x86 processor, operating systems in general and NIM. All of which is pretty stupid considering this is my first real project in NIM and the last time I wrote anything nearly as low level, was a decade ago when I wrote some code for LEGO Mindstorms.

If you're wondering where the name comes from - Assyria is the land once ruled by Nimrod, according to legend.

## Current goals

 - set up interrupts
 - set up paging and memory management
 - keyboard input

## Design goals

 - UNIX like
 - as little non-NIM code as possible
